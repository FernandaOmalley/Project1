## Analysis and Model to Predict Future Housing Price of Toronto Neighborhoods

Housing price is always a hot topic to discuss no matter you are a buyer or seller. Our analysis aims to explore what the key factors are and how they influence the pricing from both macro and micro aspects. Our report also reviews the current market and predict the future pricing by neighborhoods throught Decision tree Regression Machine Learning methodology.

Methodology: Cluster based analysis – K-means clustering is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms. In other words, the K-means algorithm identifies k number of centroids, and then allocates every data point to the nearest cluster, while keeping the centroids as small as possible.
